Information:

Non-Volatile memory (NVM) technologies have demonstrated great potential in 
improving many aspects of present and future memory hierarchies, offering 
high integration density, large capacity, zero standby power and good 
resilience to soft errors. The recent research progress of various NVMs, 
e.g., NAND flash, PCM, STT-RAM, RRAM, Racetrack, FeRAM, etc., have drawn 
tremendous attentions from both academia and industry. Besides developing 
robust and scalable devices, the unique characteristics of these NVM 
technologies introduce plenty of opportunities and challenges for novel 
circuit designs, architectures, system organizations, and management 
strategies. There is an urgent need for technology invention, modeling, 
analysis, design and application of these NVMs ranging from circuit design 
level to system level. Non-Volatile Memory Systems and Applications 
Symposium (NVMSA) seeks both research and industry papers that describe 
research or technical aspects related to NVMs. More information on 
NVMSA 2017 can be found at http://nvmsa2017.iis.sinica.edu.tw/


Call for Papers: 

NVMSA is a premier conference in the area of non-volatile memory systems and 
emerging memory technologies. It provides a fantastic opportunity for global 
nonvolatile memory researchers from different communities to discuss and 
exchange knowledge, ideas and insights, and to facilitate the establishment
of potential collaborations that can speed up the progress in the design and 
application of NVMs. An expanded technical program will be offered in NVMSA 
2017 for the audience from academia and industry. The organizing committee is
soliciting various topics on related to NVMs including, but not limited to:

Device/Circuit Design of NVM Systems:
	- Emerging NVM Circuit Design
	- NVM Device Design 
	- Error Correction for NVMs 
	- Non-volatile Logic Circuit
	- Low Power NVM Circuit
NVM Architecture and Systems:
	- Non-volatile Registers
	- Non-volatile Memory Architectures
	- Non-volatile Cache Design
	- NVM Neuromorphic Architectures
	- NVDIMM
NVM Storage:
	- Operating System Support for NVM
	- Compiler Optimization for NVM
	- NVM-based Storage Software
	- NVM-based Databases
	- NVM Controller Design
NVM Applications:
	- In-memory Computing
	- NVM for Big Data Analytics
	- NVM in Mobile Healthcare Applications
	- NVM in Wearable Applications

Submission: 

Both research and industry track papers are solicited. All papers must be 
submitted electronically in PDF format. The submitted manuscript must describe 
original work not previously published and not concurrently submitted 
lsewhere. Submissions should be no more than 6 pages in the IEEE conference 
proceedings format (two-column, single-space). Conference content will be
submitted for inclusion into IEEE Xplore, and will be EI indexed.
